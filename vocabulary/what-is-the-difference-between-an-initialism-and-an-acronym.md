# What is the difference between an initialism and an acronym

## Acronym
    
A word formed from the initial parts (letters OR syllables OR arbitrary parts) of a name.
Examples: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) or "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix).

## Initialism

A group of initial letters used as an abbreviation for a name or expression, each letter being pronounced separately.
For example, "BBC" (British Broadcasting Corporation), or HBO (Home Box Office).

## Conclusion

The key difference between an acronym and an initialism is that an acronym forms a new word, while an initalism does not.
